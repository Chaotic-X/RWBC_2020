**Prior to all of this, eon's ago, I was a computer sci major, and did most of the intro to C++. However I have forgotten most of it. :D I have 10 years working with Linux, so I am very familiar terminal, and bash scripting.**  

**I would consider myself between beginner and intermediate user of Git**

**I am done having my setbacks in life holding me back. So, I want to land an iOS Dev Job as quickly as possibly. This bootcamp is an end to that means.**
