# Week 2 Homework

I chose the refact the "finished Bulleys from the Video walk through" so I didn't have to mess with any Layout or storyboard issues.



After talking to  Jeff on Thursday... I look at the files Audrey initially supplied and found that I really didn't need to worry about a model controller and just use a model to put everything in.  

Part of what I realized was I was trying to re-invent the wheel on this project, in stead of truly looking at what pieces were missing and plug the holes.
